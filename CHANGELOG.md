# Changelog

## 0.3.1 - Reliable Python Diagnosis and Localization

### Added

- Added English and Russian interface localization with `--lang en|ru`, aliases, environment-variable support, saved configuration, and English fallback.
- Added complete Russian translations for all 105 Python diagnosis rules.
- Added `--engine python` as the explicit engine selector while retaining the old command-level `--lang python` compatibility alias.
- Added `termdoctor config language [CODE]` and `--no-history` for sensitive runs.
- Added ANSI-colored traceback support, user-defined exception support, traceback frame collection, exception chains, and nearby source-code context.
- Added strict rule metadata: `match_any`, `match_all`, `exclude`, `full_error_types`, framework constraints, and priority.
- Added more precise rules for common `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `ImportError`, `AttributeError`, and Django command failures.
- Added Pydantic as its own detected ecosystem.
- Added support for versioned Python executables, Windows `.exe` paths, and common environment runners.
- Added optional dependencies, dependency groups, Poetry groups, Pipfile, VCS/direct references, and broader requirements-file discovery.
- Added source/standard-library/local-module checks for `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- Added secret redaction, output truncation, serialized and atomic history writes, private file permissions, corrupt-history backups, and combined diagnostic output.
- Added regression and localization tests.

### Changed

- Changed rule selection so specialized rules are used only when their evidence actually matches.
- Changed framework detection to require primary evidence, preventing Pydantic/Jinja2/Werkzeug from falsely identifying FastAPI or Flask.
- Changed command diagnosis to inspect both `stdout` and `stderr`.
- Changed Python project checks so absent optional frameworks are informational instead of warnings.
- Changed reports to inspect the original failure working directory instead of the current shell directory.
- Changed report and renderer output to use generic engine-provided diagnostic sections.
- Changed package version handling to use `termdoctor.__version__` as the single source of truth.
- Changed install hints to prefer the active interpreter via `python -m pip`.
- Updated documentation, architecture examples, privacy notes, and release commands for 0.3.1.

### Fixed

- Fixed Django `CommandError` being diagnosed as an Alembic failure.
- Fixed unmatched specialized rules falling back to the first rule with the same short exception name.
- Fixed `python3.13`, Windows `python.exe`, and Windows `pytest.exe` command detection.
- Fixed ANSI escape codes and custom exception names preventing traceback parsing.
- Fixed unreachable rules for dotted or non-`*Error` exception names.
- Fixed false FastAPI detection from Pydantic alone.
- Fixed local and standard-library imports receiving inappropriate `pip install` suggestions.
- Fixed reports generated from history using unrelated project metadata.
- Fixed stale rule paths and outdated project structure in user-facing output.
- Fixed concurrent history updates losing entries.
